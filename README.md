# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Pewlett Hackard is a large company with several thousand employees.  The company has been around for a long time and with so many baby boomers as employees there is a very high likelihood that retirement will begin to occur at a high rate.  Because of this likelihood the company is planning for the future by offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria and strategizing about which positions will need to filled as there will be thousands of job openings due to the retirements.

Bobby is an up-and-coming HR analyst whose task is to perform employee research. Specifically, he needs to find answers to the following questions: Who will be retiring in the next few years? And how many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill? This analysis will help future-proof Pewlett Hackard by generating a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package. The employee data Bobby needs is only available in the form of six CSV files because Pewlett Hackard has been mainly using Excel and VBA to work with their data.  But now, they have decided to update their methods to use SQL, a definite upgrade considering the amount of data. Your task is to help Bobby build an employee database with SQL by applying your data modeling, engineering, and analysis skills.

### Purpose
Management has given two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. After retrieving the data using SQL in pgAdmin and creating .csv files for the two assignments a written report is needed that summarizes my analysis and helps prepare managment for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
